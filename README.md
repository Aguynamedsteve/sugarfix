### Google Maps Real-time Search

SugarFix is focused on bringing local businesses to users. One of the key features is an interactive map that displays the search results visually. The map allows the user to filter businesses based on what is currently shown inside the map frame.

### Content Rich Business View

Users can find all relevant business information directly on the SugarFix business pages. Useful data such as hours are dynamically rendered depending on availability. For example, if a location is closed that day, the clock icon turns red instead of green.

A select trio of food photos are featured front and center. If a menu is available, users will see the direct menu link for convenience in addition to the main business website.

Reviews are displayed in a clean format and show the reviewer photo to increase community and trust.
